# Initial Communication / Establishing Work Activity

We enjoyed collaboration on the 3rd project and decieded to continue to work together for the final project.  We established communication over #Slack and spoke over the phone to introduce ourselves properly.  Furthermore, we divided the work effort in half.  The work effort consisted of Data Preparation, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, and Conclusion.


# Ongoing Communication / Artifact Location

We both decided to communicate via email and/or #Slack.  In addition, we establihed a Final Project group folder on GitHub.

# Data

The data was acquired at https://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/database/veh/veh.htm.  (https://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/database/VSR/Download.aspx?tstno=&curno=&database=v&name=Vehdb-export&format=export)  


# Objective

Specifically, Which vehicle or set of vehicles are the safest from a head and leg injury perspective.


# Injury Criteria

Head Injury Criterion, Left Femur Load, Right Femur Load


# Analysis and Attributes 

### National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

Based on the recommendations following this section, provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, we want to perform analysis to determine which vehicles have the best and worst injury severity ratings based upon the criteria listed below and using the following attributes.

### Attributes

vehicle make, Vehicle year, Vehicle body type, and occupant location (Left-front-seat, Right-front-seat). 

### Motiviation

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration makes their recommendation using a star rating system. A greater number of Stars mean Safer Cars. 5-Star Safety Ratings measure the crashworthiness and rollover safety of vehicles. Five stars is the highest rating, one is the lowest. However, some of the vehicles getting a 5-star rating could be cost prohibitive for some consumers and provide a small variety of choices. In this instance, a more detailed analysis of the injury criteria and attributes are warranted.  

**National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Recommendations**

![National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Recommendations](images/Recommendations.png)

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Recommendations provide a basis for vehicle safety for crashworthiness and rollover. The recommendation image provides a baseline for head, leg and chest injury.  In summary, the closer the value is to absolute 0, the less likely the occupant will have a severe injury.

# HIC Discussion

The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) is a measure of the likelihood of head injury arising from an impact. The summarized data for HCI was generated by taking the maximum of HCI value for each vehicle make.

The HIC can be used to assess safety related to vehicles, personal protective gear, and sport equipment. 

Normally the variable is derived from the measurements of an accelerometer mounted at the center of mass of a crash test dummy's head, when the dummy is exposed to crash forces. This means that the HIC includes the effects of head acceleration and the duration of the acceleration. Large accelerations may be tolerated for very short times. 

At a HIC of 1000, there is an 18% probability of a severe head injury, a 55% probability of a serious injury and a 90% probability of a moderate head injury to the average adult. 


# Summarized Analysis

### What is the maximum Head Injury Criterion per vehicle?

Measured in integers, 0 to 9,999, HIC is the computed value of the head injury criterion, based on the resultant acceleration pulse for the head center of gravity. (https://www.intmath.com/applications-integration/hic-part2.php) Generally, experts agree that Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values above 1000 are life threatening.

```{r}
grid1 <- ggplot(data = data,aes(x=reorder(data$MAKED, data$HIC), y=data$HIC, fill = viridis(49), )) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.y = element_text(size=6), axis.text.x = element_text(size=7)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  geom_label(aes(label=data$HIC), position = position_dodge(width = 0.5), size = 2.4,   label.padding = unit(0.04, "lines"), label.size = 0.15, inherit.aes = TRUE)+
  labs(title = "Maximum Head Injury Criterion", x = "Vehicles", y = "Severity")+
  coord_flip()
grid1
```

### What is the maximum Left Femur Peak Load per vehicle?

Measured as an integer, LFEM indicates the maximum compression load for the left femur listed as a negative number.

```{r}
grid2 <- ggplot(data = data,aes(x=reorder(data$MAKED, data$LFL), y=data$LFL, fill = viridis(49), )) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.y = element_text(size=6), axis.text.x = element_text(size=7)) +

  geom_label(aes(label=data$LFL), position = position_dodge(width = 0.5), size = 2.4,   label.padding = unit(0.04, "lines"), label.size = 0.15, inherit.aes = TRUE)+
  labs(title = " Maximum Left Femur Peak Load", x = "Vehicles", y = "Severity")+
  coord_flip()
grid2
```

### What is the maximum Right Femur Peak Load per vehicle?

Measured as an integer, RFEM indicates the maximum compression load for the right femur listed as a negative number.

```{r}
grid3 <- ggplot(data = data,aes(x=reorder(data$MAKED, data$RFL), y=data$RFL, fill = viridis(49), )) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.y = element_text(size=6), axis.text.x = element_text(size=7)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  geom_label(aes(label=data$RFL), position = position_dodge(width = 0.5), size = 2.4,   label.padding = unit(0.04, "lines"), label.size = 0.15, inherit.aes = TRUE)+
  labs(title = " Maximum Right Femur Peak Load", x = "Vehicles", y = "Severity")+
  coord_flip()
grid3
```
  
### What is minimum Head Injury Criterion per vehicle?

```{r}
grid4 <- ggplot(data = data,aes(x=reorder(data$MAKED, data$min_HIC), y=data$min_HIC, fill = viridis(49), )) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.y = element_text(size=6), axis.text.x = element_text(size=7)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  geom_label(aes(label=data$min_HIC), position = position_dodge(width = 0.5), size = 2.4,   label.padding = unit(0.04, "lines"), label.size = 0.15, inherit.aes = TRUE)+
  labs(title = "Minimum Head Injury Criterion", x = "Vehicles", y = "Severity")+
  coord_flip()
grid4
```

### What is the minimum Left Femur Peak Load per vehicle?

```{r}
grid5 <- ggplot(data = data,aes(x=reorder(data$MAKED, data$min_LFL), y=data$min_LFL, fill = viridis(49), )) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.y = element_text(size=6), axis.text.x = element_text(size=7)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  geom_label(aes(label=data$min_LFL), position = position_dodge(width = 0.5), size = 2.4,   label.padding = unit(0.04, "lines"), label.size = 0.15, inherit.aes = TRUE)+
  labs(title = " Minimum Left Femur Peak Load", x = "Vehicles", y = "Severity")+
  coord_flip()
grid5
```

### What is the minimum Right Femur Peak Load per vehicle?

```{r}
grid6 <- ggplot(data = data,aes(x=reorder(data$MAKED, data$min_RFL), y=data$min_RFL, fill = viridis(49), )) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.y = element_text(size=6), axis.text.x = element_text(size=7)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  geom_label(aes(label=data$min_RFL), position = position_dodge(width = 0.5), size = 2.4,   label.padding = unit(0.04, "lines"), label.size = 0.15, inherit.aes = TRUE)+
  labs(title = " Minimum Right Femur Peak Load", x = "Vehicles", y = "Severity")+
  coord_flip()
grid6
```

The summarized view of the data for HCI, LFEM and RFEM does not reveal the details necessary for making a more informed decision about a vehicle.  For example, suppose a potential vehicle buyer wanted to know these values based on the year, type of vehicle, location of the occputant, etc.  The summarized views do not provide this level of detail, so it becomes necessary to retrieve data with year and type of vehicle, among other attributes.

```


# Data Analysis with Additional Attributes 

In order to simplify our analysis we have decided to separete head injury criterion, left/right femur peak load and compare them against the attributes we thought were most relevant. We will add a column that averages the HCI, LFEM and RFEM by make, year, body type of the vehicle and occupant location in the vehicle.

### Crash Test Distribution

The vehicle make that has the highest frequency of crash test observations in our data is Ford, and is then followed by Toyota, Honda, Chevrolet, Dodge, and Nissan to name a few.

```{r}
attrMake <- data2 %>% group_by(MAKED) %>% summarise("Average HIC" = mean(HIC), Count = n())
ggplot(attrMake, aes(x=reorder(MAKED, -Count), y=Count)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill = "tomato2") + labs(x = "Vehicle Make", y = "Frequency", title = "Distribution of Crash Test Observations by Vehicle Make") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8))
```

### Injury by Car Make

```{r}
attrMake_lfl <- data2 %>% group_by(MAKED) %>% summarise("Average LFL" = mean(LFL), Count = n())
attrMake_rfl <- data2 %>% group_by(MAKED) %>% summarise("Average RFL" = mean(RFL), Count = n())
```

### Data Sample by Vehicle Make

```{r}
head(attrMake)
```

In the graphs below we can see from the crash tests that among the safest vehicle makes from a head and leg injury perspective we find Porsche, Tesla, Mini and Volkswagen among others.

```{r}
ggplot(attrMake, aes(x=reorder(MAKED, `Average HIC`), y=`Average HIC`)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill = viridis(49)) + labs(x = "Car Make", y = "AVG HIC", title = "Average HIC by Car Make") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8))
ggplot(attrMake_lfl, aes(x=reorder(MAKED, -`Average LFL`), y=`Average LFL`)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill = viridis(49)) + labs(x = "Car Make", y = "AVG LFL", title = "Average LFL by Car Make") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8))
ggplot(attrMake_rfl, aes(x=reorder(MAKED, -`Average RFL`), y=`Average RFL`)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill = viridis(49)) + labs(x = "Car Make", y = "AVG RFL", title = "Average RFL by Car Make") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8))
```

### Injury by Year

```{r}
attrYear <- data2 %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% summarise("Average HIC" = mean(HIC), Count = n())
attrYear_lfl <- data2 %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% summarise("Average LFL" = mean(LFL), Count = n())
attrYear_rfl <- data2 %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% summarise("Average RFL" = mean(RFL), Count = n())
```

### Data Sample by Year

```{r}
head(attrYear)
```

During 1999 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration planned for upgrading the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS). They added new crash specifications that required the use of additional dummies of various sizes as well as additional performance criteria that appropriately represent head injury thresholds.

```{r}
ggplot(attrYear, aes(x=YEAR, y=`Average HIC`)) + geom_line(color = "tomato2") + labs(x = "Year", y = "AVG HIC", title = "Average HIC by Year") + geom_point(color = "tomato2")
ggplot(attrYear_lfl, aes(x=YEAR, y=`Average LFL`)) + geom_line(color = "tomato2") + labs(x = "Year", y = "AVG LFL", title = "Average LFL by Year") + geom_point(color = "tomato2")
ggplot(attrYear_rfl, aes(x=YEAR, y=`Average RFL`)) + geom_line(color = "tomato2") + labs(x = "Year", y = "AVG RFL", title = "Average RFL by Year") + geom_point(color = "tomato2")
```

### Injury by Vehicle Body Type

```{r}
attrBody <- data2 %>% group_by(BODYD) %>% filter (BODYD != "OTHER") %>% summarise("Average HIC" = mean(HIC), Count = n())
attrBody_lfl <- data2 %>% group_by(BODYD) %>% filter (BODYD != "OTHER") %>% summarise("Average LFL" = mean(LFL), Count = n())
attrBody_rfl <- data2 %>% group_by(BODYD) %>% filter (BODYD != "OTHER") %>% summarise("Average RFL" = mean(RFL), Count = n())
```

### Data Sample by Vehicle Body Type

```{r}
head(attrBody)
```

According to the graphs below, among the safest vehicle body types from a head and leg injury perspective we find that three door coupes, five door hatchbacks, and 4 door pickups have the lowest injury averages.

*Please Note: The category "OTHER" for body type has been removed as it is not clear what type of vehicles are included*

```{r}
ggplot(attrBody, aes(x=reorder(BODYD, `Average HIC`), y=`Average HIC`)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill = magma(15)) + labs(x = "Body Type", y = "AVG HIC", title = "Average HIC by Car Body Type") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8))
ggplot(attrBody_lfl, aes(x=reorder(BODYD, -`Average LFL`), y=`Average LFL`)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill = magma(15)) + labs(x = "Body Type", y = "AVG LFL", title = "Average LFL by Car Body Type") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8))
ggplot(attrBody_rfl, aes(x=reorder(BODYD, -`Average RFL`), y=`Average RFL`)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill = magma(15)) + labs(x = "Body Type", y = "AVG RFL", title = "Average RFL by Car Body Type") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8))
```

### Injury by Occupant Location

```{r}
attrOcc <- data2 %>% group_by(OCCLOCD) %>% summarise("Average HIC" = mean(HIC), Count = n())
attrOcc_lfl <- data2 %>% group_by(OCCLOCD) %>% summarise("Average LFL" = mean(LFL), Count = n())
attrOcc_rfl <- data2 %>% group_by(OCCLOCD) %>% summarise("Average RFL" = mean(RFL), Count = n())
```

### Data Sample by Occupant Location

```{r}
head(attrOcc)
```

According to the graphs below, one of the safest places to sit in a vehicle in the unfortunate event of a crash is the left front seat. In other words, you are the most safe when you are the driver. The second safest place to sit is in the front passenger seat.

```{r}
ggplot(attrOcc, aes(x=reorder(OCCLOCD, `Average HIC`), y=`Average HIC`)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill = plasma(8)) + labs(x = "Occupant Location", y = "AVG HIC", title = "Average HIC by Occupant Location") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8))
ggplot(attrOcc_lfl, aes(x=reorder(OCCLOCD, -`Average LFL`), y=`Average LFL`)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill = plasma(8)) + labs(x = "Occupant Location", y = "AVG LFL", title = "Average LFL by Occupant Location") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8))
ggplot(attrOcc_rfl, aes(x=reorder(OCCLOCD, -`Average RFL`), y=`Average RFL`)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill = plasma(8)) + labs(x = "Occupant Location", y = "AVG RFL", title = "Average RFL by Occupant Location") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8))
```


# Additional Analysis

Below we have another perspective for head injury criterion by occupant location looking at the data through boxplots. We can see that our boxplots agree with our analysis above, the two safest places to sit in a vehicle are in the driver seat and front passenger seat.

```{r}
qplot(OCCLOCD, HIC, data = data2, geom= "boxplot", fill = OCCLOCD) + labs(x = "Occupant Location", y = "HIC", title = "Head Injury Criterion by Occupant Location") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8)) + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

We can also look at our data by comparing vehicle make, body type and head injury criterion in the same graph in order to have a better visualization of our aggregate data. 

*Please Note: We have removed an observation (Chevrolet convertible) that was very far from the rest of the data in order to make the graph more readable. Additionally, the category "OTHER" for body type has been removed as it is not clear what type of vehicles are included*

```{r}
attrMakeBody <- data2 %>% group_by(MAKED, BODYD) %>% filter (MAKED != "CHEVROLET" | BODYD != "CONVERTIBLE", BODYD != "OTHER") %>% summarise("Average HIC" = mean(HIC), Count = n())
```

```{r}
ggplot(attrMakeBody, aes(MAKED, `Average HIC`)) + geom_point(aes(color = BODYD)) + labs(x = "Vehicle Make", y = "AVG HIC", title = "Average HIC by Vehicle Make and Body Type") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=6), legend.title = element_text(size = 8), legend.text = element_text(size = 6)) + scale_color_discrete(name = "Body Type")
```


# Transformation

The data obtained from the more granular query has many more rows with repeating fields of data.  To get a better understanding of this data, we will transform into a easier visual  model.  

```{r}
# library(treemap)
# 
# treemap(data2,
#        index=c("MAKED", "BODYD"),
#        vSize="YEAR",
#        #vColor="GNI",
#        #type="YEAR"
#        )
library(data.tree)
#data(GNI2014)
#(GNI2014)
data2$pathString <- paste("Vehicle_Make", 
                            data2$YEAR, 
                            data2$MAKED, 
                            data2$BODYD,
                            data2$OCCLOCD,
                            sep = "/")
data2tree <- as.Node(data2)
#print(data2tree, "HIC", "LFL", "RFL", limit = 200)
#plot(population)
#library(networkD3)
#acmeNetwork <- ToDataFrameNetwork(data2tree, "name")
#simpleNetwork(acmeNetwork[-3], fontSize = 12)
#plot(as.dendrogram(data2tree), center = TRUE)
# works: print(data2tree, "HIC", "LFL", "RFL")
```

Reasons for transformation:  It is increasingly becoming difficult to view the results because of the number of records in the resulset.  Every time another variable of interest is added it exponentially increases the output of records.  The difficulty becomes in "visually" consuming the data without removing any of the results.  The following data that has been transformed into a tree structure and is still too large to consume "visually".  So, we decided to ask our questions using subsets of the data as depicted below.  

```{r}
#SetGraphStyle(data2tree, rankdir = "LR", dpi="70")
#SetEdgeStyle(data2tree, arrowhead = "vee", color = "grey35", penwidth = "20")
#SetNodeStyle(data2tree, style = "filled,rounded", shape = "box", fillcolor = "GreenYellow", 
#            fontname = "helvetica", tooltip = GetDefaultTooltip, fontsize = "36", height="0.75")
#SetNodeStyle(data2tree$ACURA, fillcolor = "LightBlue", penwidth = "5px")
#plot(data2tree$`2019`$ACURA, output = "graph")
#plot(as.dendrogram(data2tree), center = TRUE)
print(data2tree, "HIC", "LFL", "RFL")
```

### What is the minimum HIC?

```{r}
subset(data2, (data2$HIC >= 1 & data2$HIC <= 10) & (data2$LFL >= -10 & data2$LFL <= -1) & (data2$RFL >= -10 & data2$RFL <= -1), select=c(MAKED, YEAR, BODYD, OCCLOCD, HIC, LFL, RFL))
subset(data2, (data2$HIC >= 11 & data2$HIC <= 50) & (data2$LFL >= -50 & data2$LFL <= -11) & (data2$RFL >= -50 & data2$RFL <= -11), select=c(MAKED, YEAR, BODYD, OCCLOCD, HIC, LFL, RFL))
subset(data2, (data2$HIC >= 51 & data2$HIC <= 100) & (data2$LFL >= -100 & data2$LFL <= -51) & (data2$RFL >= -100 & data2$RFL <= -51), select=c(MAKED, YEAR, BODYD, OCCLOCD, HIC, LFL, RFL))
```


# Conclusion

In the first output, we select a couple of vehicles with the least amount of injury to the head and legs. In addition, two additional ranges of vehicles are provided, where minimal head and leg injuries were reported.  These display results with vehicle year, vehicle body type, and occupant location in the vehicle.  The occupant location, is the test dummy used to measure different crash impact forces.  

Difficulty Encountered: As mentioned above, visualizing the large number of rows is difficult with any ease. This presented challenges in displaying the results so a consumer can easily find their vehicle of choice.  So, we decided to present the results in subsets of the overall results.
